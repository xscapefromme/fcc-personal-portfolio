Practicing and refining CSS and HTML skills. things clicking just little details need to work on but understand the overall concept.

- Little trouble with the nav bar/ header. Only reason is when Im trying to do hover how FCC did it is nav bar take the entire width without a header but how Im doing it was a header then the nav bar within the header.
- Main content used once per page and wraps the primary unique content of the page (what the page is about) set the max-width so I didn't have to do it individually to each section within the main. Its main then separated by different sections within the main. 
-Trouble with the transitioning and the hover effect as well with the ::after psuedo element. Making button into display: inline-block was the reason why since by default its an inline so that was the reason transformX wasn't moving.
-Having the right delay on hover for the projects. Still want to figure that out.
-Footer and header outside of the main element but if the footer is part of the section then obviously footer is inside of main element.
